# Making Changes to Existing Code

**Purpose**: _To appreciate the implications and consequences of modifying existing code._

_10 minutes_

### 1. View the Code [Individual Lab]

The code in the folder `federal-tax/fedtax.js` has been deemed by peers and managers to be difficult to test and maintain.

Your task is to view the code, and list, in order of priority, the changes you would make. You do not need to make the modifications at this stage, but it will be your responsibility to do so later.


### 2. Discussion

In pairs, answer these questions:

1. How confident are you that if you implemented the changes, your changes would work successfully?
2. This production code requires 100% confidence that it performs successfully. How confident are you that your changes are absolutely correct? Would you be confident of winning a lawsuit?   
    - Not at all confident?
    - 50% ?
    - 70% ?
    - 80% ?
    - 95% ?
    - 100% ?
