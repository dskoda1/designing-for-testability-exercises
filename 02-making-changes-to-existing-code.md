# Making Changes to Existing Code

**Purpose**: _To appreciate the implications of modifying code without tests in place._

Make a change to existing software, _without_ tests in place, and determine whether the changes were successful.

> Note: the changes you make must be 100% correct, and not change any other behavior.

_TODO: find an example piece of code, ideally same as weâ€™d use later._

In pairs, answer these questions:

1. How did you feel about making the changes?
2. What happened when you made these changes? Did they work?
3. How confident were you that they would work successfully?
4. Production code requires 100% confidence that it performs successfully. Did you have 100% confidence?
