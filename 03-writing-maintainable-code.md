# Writing Maintainable Code

## Using Prettier

Purpose: To see how tools and automation can aid development

1. Install Prettier:

        npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier

2. To familiarise yourself with prettier, run it from the command line on the file in `prettier-tryout/Address.js`:

        npx prettier prettier-tryout/Address.js

3. Many IDEs and editors support Prettier. If you can install a plugin for
   your IDE easily, do so and check that it formats your source files for you.
